## 🎯 Open to Senior Engineering Opportunities

With over 30 years of experience in scripting, distributed systems, infrastructure resilience, and modular system architecture, I'm seeking contract or full-time roles in:

- Fault-tolerant infrastructure and systems architecture  
- Security-first design and automation engineering  
- Blockchain systems modeling, governance, and validator logic  
- Post-quantum cryptography and telemetry-driven observability

I blend deep architectural theory with practical execution — emphasizing fit-to-need design, error trapping, and compositional clarity. Recent hands-on work includes validator rotation engines, PCI-compliant automation frameworks, telemetry emitters, and distributed network segmentation.

## 🧠 QuantumChain Coding Project

At the core of QuantumChain lies a belief that systems should not merely operate—they should articulate. Each subsystem within the network is accountable not just to the code, but to a doctrine of declared intent. The TruthSpec Meta Doctrine captures this ideology in detail, offering a blueprint for how modular components express purpose, stability conditions, failure expectations, and entropy participation.  This isn’t traditional documentation—it’s a living contract between code and governance. If you’re looking to understand how QuantumChain treats behavior not as a byproduct, but as a first-class architectural citizen, the Meta Doctrine is your map.
