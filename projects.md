# List of Projects

## ðŸ§© QuantumChain â€“ TruthSpec Architecture & Runtime Doctrine
__Role:__ Architect & Systems Strategist
__Highlights:__ 
- Designed and enforced a formal specification language (TruthSpec) to model semantic intent, behavioral guarantees, and runtime fingerprints across all modular subsystems
- Implemented a CI-integrated documentation parser with runtime validation of YAML headers, contract fields, and entropy participation
- Established a governance-aware schema index with emoji-based thematic tagging and self-healing contract discovery
- Authored the Meta Doctrine Manifest, framing the philosophical and architectural principles guiding subsystem accountability and introspection
"Systems donâ€™t just executeâ€”they declare why they exist. TruthSpec makes that declaration observable."
