# üöÄ Out-of-Band Management (OBM) Project Overview

## üìå Project Summary
- **Project Name:** ILO Project (renamed to OBM)
- **Timeline:** 2012‚Äì2013
- **Goal:** Enable full remote server lifecycle management after relocating hardware to North Carolina while admins remained in Arizona.

### üîç Why It Mattered
Managing servers from thousands of miles away isn't just about remote logins. Admins needed:
- Post-event diagnostics during boot-up
- BIOS/firmware updates and reboots
- Mounting of ISO/USB devices remotely
- Full power control and network provisioning

These actions couldn‚Äôt be reliably executed with traditional tools like KVM, leading to the birth of a dedicated Out-of-Band strategy.

## üîê SSL and Security Challenges

### ‚ùå Initial Roadblock
The project ground to a halt early‚ÄîSSL issues:
- **Context:** Some OOB-capable devices required SSL ‚â§ 1.2 for AD authentication.
- **Policy:** Org-wide ban on SSL below v1.2 due to vulnerabilities like man-in-the-middle attacks.

### üß† The Breakthrough
- Reviewed policy line-by-line to scope exceptions
- Found an **F5 device** on the management network
- Proposed it serve as a secure proxy for AD auth‚Äîeliminating direct server-to-AD communication

> üìé **Security Insight:**
> Policy exceptions were precisely worded to allow SSL 1.2 *only* on the management network. All tunnel endpoints were authenticated and logged via the F5.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Execution

### ‚úÖ Hardware Compatibility
OBM cards on HP, Dell, IBM (ILO, IMM, DRAC)

#### üîÅ BIOS/Firmware Update Strategy
| Scenario | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Version below AuthReq, no reboot required | Upgrade to highest non-reboot version |
| Version below AuthReq, reboot required | Upgrade as far as possible, preconfigure, log incomplete |
| Stepped upgrades | Applied where version skips were unsupported (e.g., v1 ‚Üí v3 required v2 first) |

```bash
# Sample logic pseudo-code for update decisions
if [ "$requires_reboot" = false ] && [ "$meets_authreq" = false ]; then
  apply_stepped_update
elif [ "$requires_reboot" = true ]; then
  partial_update
  configure_hostname_and_ip
  log_incomplete
fi
```
## üîê Authentication Design

### üéØ Objectives
- Use AD groups for access management
- Apply read-only by default
- Existing AD groups could elevate privileges with temporary admin access

> üõ°Ô∏è **Security Detail:** Authentication was layered using existing group privileges rather than expanding them. This ensured tight RBAC compliance while allowing controlled elevation when needed.

## üíª Supported Platforms

| OS Family | Versions                              |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| Windows   | NT4, 2000, 2008, 2012                  |
| VMware    | 4.1, 5.0 (Bash & remote PowerShell)    |
| Linux     | Red Hat (Korn/Bash tooling for config) |

> üéì **Historical Note:** Bash was more primitive in 2012, especially for XML or memory-based configs. Korn proved better for structured blobs.

## üß† Programming Language Usage

| Language    | Purpose                                                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Perl        | Used for script launching; full stack limited by module policies |
| Batch       | Legacy NT4 scripting                                             |
| PowerShell  | Versioned scripts tailored to OS specs                           |
| Korn        | XML blob management on Linux systems                             |
| Bash        | Host info, navigation, binary execution, Korn launcher           |

```Ksh
# Korn example: XML generation
echo "<config>" > server_config.xml
echo "<hostname>$HOSTNAME</hostname>" >> server_config.xml
echo "</config>" >> server_config.xml

```

###üìã Error Handling & Logging
- Try/Catch Logic: Captures BIOS/FW states, IPs, hostnames
- Error Codes: Matched against known matrix; unknown codes flagged
- Logs: Separated into success/failure logs with detailed tracebacks


```Bash
# Bash snippet for exit logging
log_exit() {
  echo "$HOSTNAME | $IP | BIOS:$BIOS_VERSION | FW:$FW_VERSION" >> success.log
}

```
